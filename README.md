# bmi-calculator
Console application that calculates a users Body Mass Index.<br>
Completed as part of studying 'BIT502 - Fundamentals of Programming' at The Open Polytechnic of New Zealand (BIT = Bachelor of Information Technology).<br><br>
This C# console appliation was built to satisfy the following requirements:<br>
• From a main menu, allow the user to easily select from two options: Calculate 
BMI, or View Membership rates.<br><br>

o The Calculate BMI option will prompt the user to enter their height and 
weight and perform the calculation.<br> 
The BMI result is then displayed to 
the User. BMI calculation is shown below for your reference:
BMI = weight (kg) / [height (m)]2
In two simple steps,: 
multiply the height in meters (m) by itself
divide the weight in kilograms (kg) by the step 1 result.
For example, an Adult of 1.8m tall and weighing 75 kg:
BMI Step 1 = 1.8 × 1.8 = 3.24
BMI Step 2 = 75 ÷ 3.24 
BMI = 23.15
• The result should also show the following information:
o If the BMI is under 18.5 then display text ’Underweight’.
o If between 18.5–25, then display text ’Normal’.
o If between 25–30, then display text ’Overweight’.
o If 30 or above, then display text ’Obese’.<br><br>

The View Membership rates option should ask the user what type of 
membership they would like: Basic, Regular, or Premium.<br>
Membership cost per week is $10 for ‘Basic’, $15 for ‘Regular’ and $20 for ‘Premium’.<br> 
Once the membership type is chosen, the Weekly and Monthly membership rate should 
be displayed to the user.<br><br>

The user should be able to navigate between the main menu and carry out
other operations without needing to terminate the program. There should also 
be an option to ’exit‘ or terminate at any stage when the program is running.
